# ToDoAPIProject  So this is the third version of the API that I've done. I have no clue what I'm doing wrong, everything seems right, but on no version have I been able to actually see anything in the browser. I cobbled this one together from the previous 2 attempts at APIs I've did, so it's at least easier to read than the others were. Also, I'm not really sure why there are views? I didn't think there were Views in the Resources API, so I'm not sure what to do with those.  :(
